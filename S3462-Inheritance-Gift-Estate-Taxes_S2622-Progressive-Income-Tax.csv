§ 2.	The tax law is amended by adding a new section 620-b to read as follows: 			
(§2.) § 620-b.	Credit against separate tax on inheritance income. A resident shall be allowed a credit against the tax imposed by section six hundred four of this article in the amount of the estate tax imposed by article twenty-six of this chapter or any estate or inheritance tax imposed by another state of the United States, a political subdivision of such state, or the District of Columbia, upon any inheritance income, as such term is defined in such section, received by such resident in a taxable year. Such resident may elect to calculate the amount of such credit in accordance with either subsection (a) or subsection (b) of this section. 			
(§2.) § 620-b.(a)	The amount of credit allowed pursuant to this section may be calculated by multiplying the total amount of estate or inheritance tax imposed by this state, another state of the United States, a political subdivision of such state, or the District of Columbia on the estate from which such resident has received inheritance income by a fraction, the numerator of which is the amount of inheritance income received by such resident from such estate and the denominator of which is the total value of such estate after the federal estate tax has been paid but before the estate tax of this state, or any estate or inheritance tax imposed by another state of the United States, a political subdivision of such state, or the District of Columbia, has been paid. In order to calculate such credit in accordance with this subsection, such resident must know the total amount of estate or inheritance tax imposed on such estate by this state, another state of the United States, a political subdivision of such state, or the District of Columbia and the total value of such estate after the federal estate tax has been paid but before the estate or inheritance tax of this state, another state of the United States, a political subdivision of such state, or the District of Columbia, has been paid. 			
(§2.) § 620-b.(b)	The amount of credit allowed pursuant to this section may be calculated as equal to the amount of estate tax or inheritance tax of this state, another state of the United States, a political subdivision of such state, or the District of Columbia, that would be imposed on the estate from which such resident receives inheritance income as if such inheritance income were equal to the total value of such estate.

Such individual may elect to calculate the amount of such credit in accordance with either subsection (a) or subsection (b) of this section. 			
(§4.) § 640.(a)	The amount of credit allowed pursuant to this section may be calculated by multiplying the total amount of estate or inheritance tax imposed by this state, another state of the United States, a political subdivision of such state, or the District of Columbia on the estate from which such individual has received inheritance income by a fraction, the numerator of which is the amount of inheritance income received by such individual from such estate and the denominator of which is the total value of such estate after the federal estate tax has been paid but before the estate tax of this state, or any estate or inheritance tax imposed by another state of the United States, a political subdivision of such state, or the District of Columbia, has been paid. In order to calculate such credit in accordance with this subsection, such individual must know the total amount of estate or inheritance tax imposed on such estate by this state, another state of the United States, a political subdivision of such state, or the District of Columbia and the total value of such estate after the federal estate tax has been paid but before the estate or inheritance tax of this state, another state of the United States, a political subdivision of such state, or the District of Columbia, has been paid. 			
(§4.) § 640.(b)	The amount of credit allowed pursuant to this section may be calculated as equal to the amount of estate tax or inheritance tax of this state, another state of the United States, a political subdivision of such state, or the District of Columbia that would be imposed on the estate from which such individual receives inheritance income as if such inheritance income were equal to the total value of such estate.
