3	1.	1.5 - 1.17	Climate change, resulting primarily from the combustion of fossil fuels, is an immediate, grave threat to the state's communities, environment, and economy. In addition to mitigating the further buildup of greenhouse gases, the state must take action to adapt to certain consequences of climate change that are irreversible, including rising sea levels, increasing temperatures, extreme weather events, flooding, heat waves, toxic algal blooms and other climate-change-driven threats. Maintaining New York's quality of life into the future, particularly for young people, who will experience greater impacts from climate change over their lifetimes, will be one of the state's greatest challenges over the next three decades. Meeting that challenge will require a shared commitment of purpose and huge investments in new or upgraded infrastructure. 	climate, change, resulting, primarily, from, the, combustion, of, fossil, fuels, is, an, immediate, grave, threat, to, the, state's, communities, environment, and, economy, in, addition, to, mitigating, the, further, buildup, of, greenhouse, gases, the, state, must, take, action, to, adapt, to, certain, consequences, of, climate, change, that, are, irreversible, including, rising, sea, levels, increasing, temperatures, extreme, weather, events, flooding, heat, waves, toxic, algal, blooms, and, other, climate, change, driven, threats, maintaining, new, york's, quality, of, life, into, the, future, particularly, for, young, people, who, will, experience, greater, impacts, from, climate, change, over, their, lifetimes, will, be, one, of, the, state's, greatest, challenges, over, the, next, three, decades, meeting, that, challenge, will, require, a, shared, commitment, of, purpose, and, huge, investments, in, new, or, upgraded, infrastructure	climate, resulting, primarily, combustion, fossil, fuels, immediate, grave, threat, state's, communities, environment, economy, addition, mitigating, buildup, greenhouse, gases, state, action, adapt, certain, consequences, irreversible, rising, sea, levels, increasing, temperatures, extreme, weather, events, flooding, heat, waves, toxic, algal, blooms, driven, threats, maintaining, new, york's, quality, life, future, particularly, experience, greater, impacts, lifetimes, greatest, challenges, decades, meeting, challenge, require, shared, commitment, purpose, huge, investments, upgraded, infrastructure	§ 2.1.	64

8	b.	2.16 - 2.25	Nonetheless, the legislature recognizes that the actions of many of the biggest fossil fuel companies have been unconscionable, closely reflecting the strategy of denial, deflection, and delay used by the tobacco industry. In spite of the information provided by their own scientists that the continued burning of fossil fuels would have catastrophic results, these companies hid the truth from the public and actively spread false information that the science of climate change was uncertain when in fact it was beyond controversy.

9	c.	2.26 - 2.31	In 2022, the fossil fuel industry has taken advantage of several overlapping global crises to earn immense profits, charging record high prices while aggressively rejecting any responsibility for the costs of its business activities. While all the profits accrue to the companies, all of the costs of climate change are paid by taxpayers.
