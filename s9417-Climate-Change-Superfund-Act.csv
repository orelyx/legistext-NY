1	1.1 - 1.2	§ 1.	"This act shall be known and may be cited as the ""climate change superfund act"". "
2	1.3 - 1.4	§ 2.	Legislative findings. The legislature finds and declares the following: 
3	1.5 - 1.17	§ 2.1.	Climate change, resulting primarily from the combustion of fossil fuels, is an immediate, grave threat to the state's communities, environment, and economy. In addition to mitigating the further buildup of greenhouse gases, the state must take action to adapt to certain consequences of climate change that are irreversible, including rising sea levels, increasing temperatures, extreme weather events, flooding, heat waves, toxic algal blooms and other climate-change-driven threats. Maintaining New York's quality of life into the future, particularly for young people, who will experience greater impacts from climate change over their lifetimes, will be one of the state's greatest challenges over the next three decades. Meeting that challenge will require a shared commitment of purpose and huge investments in new or upgraded infrastructure. 
4	1.18 - 1.24	§ 2.2.	New York has previously adopted programs now in place - the inactive hazardous waste disposal site (state superfund) program and the oil spill fund - to remediate environmental damage to lands and waters based on the principle that, where possible, the entities responsible for environmental damage should pay for its cleanup. No similar program exists yet for the pollution of the atmosphere by greenhouse gas buildup as a result of burning fossil fuels. 
5	1.25 - 2.3	§ 2.3.	Based on decades of research it is now possible to determine with great accuracy the share of greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere by specific fossil fuel companies over the last 70 years or more, making it possible to assign liability to and require compensation from companies commensurate with their emissions during a given time period. 
6	2.4 - 2.9	§ 2.4.	It is the intent of the legislature to establish a climate change adaptation cost recovery program that will require companies that have contributed significantly to the buildup of climate change-driving greenhouse gases in the atmosphere to bear a proportionate share of the cost of infrastructure investments required to adapt to the impacts of climate change in New York state. 
7	2.10 - 2.15	§ 2.5.	a. The obligation to pay under the program is based on the fossil fuel companies' historic contribution to the buildup of greenhouse gases that is largely responsible for climate change. The program operates under a standard of strict liability; companies are required to pay into the fund because the use of their products caused the pollution. No finding of wrongdoing is required. 
8	2.16 - 2.25	§ 2.5.b.	Nonetheless, the legislature recognizes that the actions of many of the biggest fossil fuel companies have been unconscionable, closely reflecting the strategy of denial, deflection, and delay used by the tobacco industry. In spite of the information provided by their own scientists that the continued burning of fossil fuels would have catastrophic results, these companies hid the truth from the public and actively spread false information that the science of climate change was uncertain when in fact it was beyond controversy. This breach of the public trust was breathtaking in its scope and consequences, and it continues to this day. 
9	2.26 - 2.31	§ 2.5.c.	In 2022, the fossil fuel industry has taken advantage of several overlapping global crises to earn immense profits, charging record high prices while aggressively rejecting any responsibility for the costs of its business activities. While all the profits accrue to the companies, all of the costs of climate change are paid by taxpayers. This is a market failure that needs to be addressed through policy change. 
10	2.32 - 2.39	§ 2.5.	Payments by historical polluters into the climate change adaptation cost recovery program would be used for new or upgraded infrastructure needs such as sea walls, storm water drain system upgrades and air conditioning in public buildings, including school buildings, all of which are necessary to protect the public safety and welfare in the face of the growing impacts of climate change. At least 35% of the overall benefits of program spending would go to climate change adaptive infrastructure projects that directly benefit disadvantaged communities. 
11	2.40 - 2.43	§ 2.6.	This act is not intended to intrude on the authority of the federal government in areas where it has preempted the right of the states to legislate. This act is remedial in nature, seeking compensation for damages resulting from the past actions of polluters.
