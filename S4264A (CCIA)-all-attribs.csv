20	7.	2.50 - 3.2	In the spring of 2020, New York experienced the devastating impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic. Tens of thousands of New Yorkers died, and many hundreds of thousands more became ill. Air pollution played a significant role in this pandemic, as residents of communities of color who live in highly polluted areas died disproportionately from Covid-19 when compared to patients from less polluted neighborhoods. Throughout the pandemic, New Yorkers of color continue to disproportionately contract, fall ill, and die from Covid-19, in part because of disproportionate exposure to toxic air pollution. 	in, the, spring, of, 2020, new, york, experienced, the, devastating, impacts, of, the, covid, 19, pandemic, tens, of, thousands, of, new, yorkers, died, and, many, hundreds, of, thousands, more, became, ill, air, pollution, played, a, significant, role, in, this, pandemic, as, residents, of, communities, of, color, who, live, in, highly, polluted, areas, died, disproportionately, from, covid, 19, when, compared, to, patients, from, less, polluted, neighborhoods, throughout, the, pandemic, new, yorkers, of, color, continue, to, disproportionately, contract, fall, ill, and, die, from, covid, 19, in, part, because, of, disproportionate, exposure, to, toxic, air, pollution	spring, new, york, experienced, devastating, impacts, covid, pandemic, tens, thousands, yorkers, died, hundreds, became, ill, air, pollution, played, significant, role, residents, communities, live, highly, polluted, areas, disproportionately, compared, patients, neighborhoods, throughout, continue, contract, fall, die, disproportionate, exposure, toxic	§ 2.7.	38
21	8.	3.3 - 3.13	The Covid-19 pandemic has also caused a national economic crisis which has also severely impacted New York State. Many New Yorkers lost their jobs during the Covid-19 pandemic, with unemployment rates reaching levels not seen since the Great Depression. Such mass job loss increased precarity for thousands of New Yorkers and left many less able to weather current or future emergencies. Child and dependent care shortages are and continue to be a barrier to work in New York, especially for women, who disproportionately take on unpaid caregiving responsibilities when their family cannot find or afford child and dependent care. Low and middle-income families and families of color disproportionately lack access to quality child and dependent care. 	the, covid, 19, pandemic, has, also, caused, a, national, economic, crisis, which, has, also, severely, impacted, new, york, state, many, new, yorkers, lost, their, jobs, during, the, covid, 19, pandemic, with, unemployment, rates, reaching, levels, not, seen, since, the, great, depression, such, mass, job, loss, increased, precarity, for, thousands, of, new, yorkers, and, left, many, less, able, to, weather, current, or, future, emergencies, child, and, dependent, care, shortages, are, and, continue, to, be, a, barrier, to, work, in, new, york, especially, for, women, who, disproportionately, take, on, unpaid, caregiving, responsibilities, when, their, family, cannot, find, or, afford, child, and, dependent, care, low, and, middle, income, families, and, families, of, color, disproportionately, lack, access, to, quality, child, and, dependent, care	covid, pandemic, caused, national, economic, crisis, severely, impacted, new, york, state, yorkers, lost, jobs, unemployment, rates, reaching, levels, seen, depression, mass, job, loss, increased, precarity, thousands, weather, future, emergencies, child, dependent, shortages, continue, barrier, work, especially, women, disproportionately, unpaid, caregiving, responsibilities, family, cannot, afford, middle, income, families, lack, access, quality	§ 2.8.	50
22	9.	3.14 - 3.26	New York state has an interest in reducing air pollution that increases risk for Covid-19 and ensuring that all populations are equally able to breathe clean air and live healthful lives. Actions undertaken by New York to reduce air pollution should prioritize the health and safety of disadvantaged communities, prioritize the allocation of public investments in these areas, and control potential regressive impacts of climate policies on these communities. Further, it is in the interest of the state to invest in creating stable and safe employment opportunities for individuals who have lost their jobs as part of the Covid-19 recession. This includes protecting and promoting the ability for all workers to equitably participate in a just clean energy transition by increasing equitable and comprehensive access to child and dependent care. 	new, york, state, has, an, interest, in, reducing, air, pollution, that, increases, risk, for, covid, 19, and, ensuring, that, all, populations, are, equally, able, to, breathe, clean, air, and, live, healthful, lives, actions, undertaken, by, new, york, to, reduce, air, pollution, should, prioritize, the, health, and, safety, of, disadvantaged, communities, prioritize, the, allocation, of, public, investments, in, these, areas, and, control, potential, regressive, impacts, of, climate, policies, on, these, communities, further, it, is, in, the, interest, of, the, state, to, invest, in, creating, stable, and, safe, employment, opportunities, for, individuals, who, have, lost, their, jobs, as, part, of, the, covid, 19, recession, this, includes, protecting, and, promoting, the, ability, for, all, workers, to, equitably, participate, in, a, just, clean, energy, transition, by, increasing, equitable, and, comprehensive, access, to, child, and, dependent, care	new, york, state, interest, reducing, air, pollution, increases, risk, covid, ensuring, populations, equally, breathe, clean, live, healthful, lives, actions, undertaken, reduce, prioritize, health, safety, disadvantaged, communities, allocation, public, investments, areas, control, potential, regressive, impacts, climate, policies, invest, creating, stable, safe, employment, opportunities, individuals, lost, jobs, recession, protecting, promoting, ability, workers, equitably, participate, energy, transition, increasing, equitable, comprehensive, access, child, dependent	§ 2.9.	60
23	10.	3.27 - 3.35	Racial justice and environmental justice are inextricably linked to achieving a just clean energy transition in New York. The murder of George Floyd on May 25, 2020 was followed by mass protests for Black lives in New York state and throughout the nation. These movements have forced a national reckoning with the fact that racial injustice has resulted in over-policing and mass incarceration of communities of color. It is in the interest of the state of New York that no funds from programs for pricing greenhouse gas emissions are invested in police, prisons or related infrastructure. 	racial, justice, and, environmental, justice, are, inextricably, linked, to, achieving, a, just, clean, energy, transition, in, new, york, the, murder, of, george, floyd, on, may, 25, 2020, was, followed, by, mass, protests, for, black, lives, in, new, york, state, and, throughout, the, nation, these, movements, have, forced, a, national, reckoning, with, the, fact, that, racial, injustice, has, resulted, in, over, policing, and, mass, incarceration, of, communities, of, color, it, is, in, the, interest, of, the, state, of, new, york, that, no, funds, from, programs, for, pricing, greenhouse, gas, emissions, are, invested, in, police, prisons, or, related, infrastructure	racial, justice, environmental, inextricably, linked, achieving, clean, energy, transition, new, york, murder, george, floyd, may, followed, mass, protests, black, lives, state, throughout, nation, movements, forced, national, reckoning, injustice, resulted, policing, incarceration, communities, interest, funds, programs, pricing, greenhouse, gas, emissions, invested, police, prisons, related, infrastructure	§ 2.10.	44

26	13.	3.50 - 4.6	Ensuring career opportunities are created and shared geographically and demographically is necessary to ensure increased access to good jobs for marginalized communities while making the same neighborhoods more resilient. Climate change has a disproportionate impact on low-income people, communities of color, women, youth, children and workers. This includes formerly incarcerated individuals. Disadvantaged communities and workers must have access to all aspects of the state's clean energy economy, including as investors and developers of clean energy projects.     It is in the interest of the state of New York to protect and promote the interests of these groups against the impacts of climate change and severe weather events and to advance our equity goals by ensuring quality employment opportunities in safe working environments. 	ensuring, career, opportunities, are, created, and, shared, geographically, and, demographically, is, necessary, to, ensure, increased, access, to, good, jobs, for, marginalized, communities, while, making, the, same, neighborhoods, more, resilient, climate, change, has, a, disproportionate, impact, on, low, income, people, communities, of, color, women, youth, children, and, workers, this, includes, formerly, incarcerated, individuals, disadvantaged, communities, and, workers, must, have, access, to, all, aspects, of, the, state's, clean, energy, economy, including, as, investors, and, developers, of, clean, energy, projects, it, is, in, the, interest, of, the, state, of, new, york, to, protect, and, promote, the, interests, of, these, groups, against, the, impacts, of, climate, change, and, severe, weather, events, and, to, advance, our, equity, goals, by, ensuring, quality, employment, opportunities, in, safe, working, environments	ensuring, career, opportunities, shared, geographically, demographically, necessary, ensure, increased, access, jobs, marginalized, communities, neighborhoods, resilient, climate, disproportionate, impact, income, women, youth, children, workers, formerly, incarcerated, individuals, disadvantaged, aspects, state's, clean, energy, economy, investors, developers, projects, interest, state, new, york, protect, promote, interests, impacts, severe, weather, events, advance, equity, goals, quality, employment, safe, working, environments	§ 2.13.	54
27	14.	4.7 - 4.15	Addressing climate change challenges through the expansion and growth of clean and renewable energy sources requires New York to make substantial proprietary and financial investments in this sector and to become an investor and partner in the development of renewable energy programs and projects. New York has long provided forms of state assistance, including grants, energy credits, or tax incentives to developers, project owners and other entities proposing clean and renewable energy projects. Key findings relating to state assistance in the clean and renewable energy sector are as follows: 	addressing, climate, change, challenges, through, the, expansion, and, growth, of, clean, and, renewable, energy, sources, requires, new, york, to, make, substantial, proprietary, and, financial, investments, in, this, sector, and, to, become, an, investor, and, partner, in, the, development, of, renewable, energy, programs, and, projects, new, york, has, long, provided, forms, of, state, assistance, including, grants, energy, credits, or, tax, incentives, to, developers, project, owners, and, other, entities, proposing, clean, and, renewable, energy, projects, key, findings, relating, to, state, assistance, in, the, clean, and, renewable, energy, sector, are, as, follows	addressing, climate, challenges, expansion, growth, clean, renewable, energy, sources, requires, new, york, substantial, proprietary, financial, investments, sector, investor, partner, development, programs, projects, forms, state, assistance, grants, credits, tax, incentives, developers, project, owners, entities, proposing, findings, relating, follows	§ 2.14.	37
28	(a)	4.16 - 4.28	providing forms of state assistance in renewable energy projects results in New York becoming a co-investor in this sector with strong financial, proprietary interests in the projects it supports. Such assistance is essential since the expansion and development of this market, would not occur at the scale and pace needed without substantial financial investment by the state. New York has already invested billions of dollars in promoting its renewable energy programs and will continue to invest substantial sums over the next several years to assist the growth and development of the sector. Such investments are critical not only for the development of individual renewable energy projects, but also to ensure that projects are effectively planned and executed and produce adequate amounts of clean energy needed to meet the state's future needs for safe, affordable reliable power; 	providing, forms, of, state, assistance, in, renewable, energy, projects, results, in, new, york, becoming, a, co, investor, in, this, sector, with, strong, financial, proprietary, interests, in, the, projects, it, supports, such, assistance, is, essential, since, the, expansion, and, development, of, this, market, would, not, occur, at, the, scale, and, pace, needed, without, substantial, financial, investment, by, the, state, new, york, has, already, invested, billions, of, dollars, in, promoting, its, renewable, energy, programs, and, will, continue, to, invest, substantial, sums, over, the, next, several, years, to, assist, the, growth, and, development, of, the, sector, such, investments, are, critical, not, only, for, the, development, of, individual, renewable, energy, projects, but, also, to, ensure, that, projects, are, effectively, planned, and, executed, and, produce, adequate, amounts, of, clean, energy, needed, to, meet, the, state's, future, needs, for, safe, affordable, reliable, power	providing, forms, state, assistance, renewable, energy, projects, results, new, york, becoming, investor, sector, strong, financial, proprietary, interests, supports, essential, expansion, development, market, occur, scale, pace, needed, substantial, investment, invested, billions, dollars, promoting, programs, continue, invest, sums, years, assist, growth, investments, critical, individual, ensure, effectively, planned, executed, produce, adequate, amounts, clean, state's, future, needs, safe, affordable, reliable, power	§ 2.14.(a)	57
